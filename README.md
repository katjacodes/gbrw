# Great Big Rainbow World

[View deployed site here](#)

## Project Description

The online presence for Great Big Rainbow World was created by Katja Schatte as a digital home for the musical, which is set to premiere in Minneapolis, MN in June 2022.

Great Big Rainbow World was written and produced by Sarah Julius and features a majority LGBTQ+ cast. The musical was originally scheduled to premiere in June 2020. However, due to the COVID19 pandemic, the stage premiere had to be rescheduled several times. This gave Sarah Julius the opportunity to replace the template-based original website with a custom online presence. The goal of the initial version of the new website is to share information about the musical ahead of its premiere and give the public a taste of the musical's original score. Subsequent version of the website will include a contact form, a link to the musical soundtrack on Spotify, and ticket purchase functionality.

Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the business goals of this website are in flux and can be divided into two categories: goals that are relevant at all times and goals that will become relevant only after the pandemic.

General goals of this website:
* Drive traffic to the musical's Spotify page to garner revenue through Spotify clicks 
* Introduce visitors to the overall theme of the musical with a focus on being light-hearted, women- and LGBTQIA-centered, while still addressing widely relatable issues
* Be appealing to the core audience (based on social media data), Gen Z through Gen X, across the spectrum of gender identity an sexual orientation
* Provide information and a point of contact for the media
* Provide exposure for cast and team members and existing sponsors (coming soon)
* Connect to the musical's social media presence

Goals toward the end of / after the pandemic:
* Ticket sales functionality (coming later)

## Features

#### Across Pages
Each page features a responsive **navigation bar** with conventional placing of **logo** (top left).
Each page has a **footer** with **copyright information**. 

Every page features a background created by the same artist who created to artwork for posters, flyers, and social media presence to make sure the website is on brand. 

#### Home
The home page features a background imagethat draws the vistor's attention to the central topic of the musical: rugby. The background image is cropped to make the content recognizable and aesthetically appealing across devices and screen orientations. To that end, there are three different versions of the image: a version for screens below 768px, a version for screens above 768px, and a version for phone and tablet screens in portrait orientation.

The **Jumbotron** on the homepage features the two major ways visitors can interact with the musical at this point: A direct **link to the contact form** and a **Spotify button** leading the visitor to the musical's Spotify. At the moment, the client is particularly interested in visitors visiting the musical's Spotify page to generate revenue and for visitors to have an easy way to stay up to date about new developments, including a new premier dates. Due to the evolving business needs of the client, the homepage is designed in a way that its content can easily be updated and adapted. 

#### About
The About page features a brief synopsis and background information about the musical. The copy was provided by Sarah Julius, writer, composer and producer of _Great Big Rainbow World_. Visitors who prefer traditional writing to social media content or who are looking for a quick way to get an overview of the musical (e.g., for potential media requests), this page provides all the necessary information.

##### Cast + Team and Individual Profile Pages
The cast and teams page consists of **two responsive grids**: one featuring the **pictures and names** of the cast and one featuring the pictures and names of the creative team. The standard setting of the grid is two images per row. Above that, the grid features three images per row on screens 768px and above, four images per row on screens 992px and above, and six images per row on screens 1400px and above. In addition, the image size increases for screens 768px and above. The purpose of this structure is to provide a clean and organized overview of everyone involved, despite the relatively large number or cast and team members. 

In addition, each image and name is clickable and **links** an **individual profile** featuring a profile image (larger for screens 992px and above, the cast or team member's name, pronouns, and role and a brief quote and personal information. The breakpoint for the styling of the quotes is 576px to strike a balance between readability and aesthetics. 

All content for the grid and the individual pages was provided by the artists themselves.

#### Sponsors
Due to the tight deadline of the course, it was agreed upon with the client to post a **"Coming Soon"** disclaimer on the sponsors page for now. After the next update, the sponsors pags will be styled simiarly to the cast and team page, featuring the logos and names of all current sponsors.

#### Contact
The contact page consists of three sections. The first section features links to the musicals **Facebook** and **Instagram** presence. The second section consists of sign-up form for the **newsletter**, which requests the visitor's email address followed by a *Submit  button**.  Finally, the third section consists of message form requesting the visitor's name and email address followed by a box to leave a message and another **Submit button**.
